Two pre requisite
1. VirtualBox 
2. Download ISO of CentOS

Theory:

Basic of Linux:

1. Open Source OS, source code is available.
2. Linux provide security.
3. Linux system --> Package (Deb, RPM, YUM) --> Repository
4. What is the difference between RPM and YUM?

RPM (Redhat Package Manager ) VS YUM (Yellow Dog Updater)

i. RPM install single package at a time whereas YUM install multiple package at a time. 
ii. RPM cannot resolve the package dependencies whereas YUM can.
iii. Roll back cannot be done in RPM whereas YUM can rollback.


Aechitecture of Linux:

Hardware (Wants to communicate with OS)
Kernel (It helps to interact with OS and Hardware)

Hardware <----> Kernel <----> Shell (OS) <----> Application

-- So the virtual box is a Hypervisor, which helps
where we could run OS, we can interact with the hardware like RAM allocation, stroage allocation.

Linux Commands:
1. whoami --> who is the user?
2. ls --> What is there in the current directory
3. cd --> change directory to another directory
4. cd` --> take us to home directory.
5. pwd --> will show the corrent directory
6. ls -l --> will show the permission of the diffrent fill present in the directory.
7. mkdir --> make directory ( folder )
8. touch --> create files
9. rm --> remove or deleted a file
10. chmod --> change the permission of the file for User, Group and Other. The permissions are Read (4), Write (2) and Execute (1)

--- Task 1:
Question : Go to a directory of desktop & there I need to make a directory named as dev and inside that directory create a text file named devops.txt --> chmod permission of the text file to 777.

Solution : First create the a directory in the desktop and create a file, now we have to deal with the permission of the file. 

A file has Read, Write and Execute
Read permission stands for --> 4
Write permission stands for --> 2
Execute permission stands for --> 1

Total 4 + 2 + 1---> 7
so if there is a file and I want to give 777 permission, then it will be
User     Group      Other
 7         7	      7 

You can see User, Group and Other when we do ls -l for a file. eg -rw-rw-r-- 1 abhisek abhisek 0 Sep  8 19:28 devops.txt

** Sum of Read, Write and Execute in Linux is 7
The command will be chmod 777 devops.txt
